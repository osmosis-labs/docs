# Customizability

As already stated, each outpost chain can compose style its own *widget* by 
customizing the provided one in its *colours*, to later include it in an 
existing dApp.

We provide you both the design file (the 
[**Figma** link](https://www.figma.com/file/qOzjC3bBlFk9CQZW2HK5jX/nabla---Outpost-UI-Kit))
of a dApp (an example Frontend Platform Interface) which includes this widget,
and the widget package for react (the link to the 
[**npm** package](https://example.com)).
<!-- TODO: add official link to the npm package -->

In this way, you can both edit the design and set the widget by code to match 
your specific requirements. 

The widget uses a theme, which allows you to customize the entire interface by
simply changing **a palette of colors**.

> **_NOTE:_**  To get more information about what you can change in the page,
please see the documentation [here](./theme-customization).
