# Introduction

Each Osmosis outpost platform is provided with a *frontend platform interface*
allowing the user to have a *simple interaction* directly from the browser, by 
using the power provided by the **Osmosis smart contracts** and the **IBC** 
**protocol**.

Such an interface, **customizable** in its colors to match the outpost chain
**branding** is a plug-and-play dapp that can be installed by any outpost 
chain in very few steps, enabling the users for **swaps** without the need to 
construct a DEx and provide liquidity.

Moreover, thanks to the **components library** realized by nabla, the 
developers can also choose to both build a **completely custom** version of 
the user interface and embed part of the interface in *any existing other*
*application*.
