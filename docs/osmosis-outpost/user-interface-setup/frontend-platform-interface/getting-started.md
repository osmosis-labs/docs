# Getting Started

Any Osmosis outpost chain can compose its own *frontend platform interface*.
The default platform is *provided with all the functionalities* needed to 
allow the users performing swaps. It is branded with the *colours and logo* of
the outpost chain, and contains *links* to the project.

Such a platform is **responsive**, makes use of cosmos-kit and is provided with
all the logic necessary to provide a *plug-and-play dApp*. The example of a 
dummy nabla outpost (*nabla is not a chain*) is presented below.

If you are interested in customizing the interface of your own outpost, please 
follow the instructions [here](./customization-guide/customizability).
