# Design Customization
We provide you the 
[**Figma** link](https://www.figma.com/file/qOzjC3bBlFk9CQZW2HK5jX/nabla---Outpost-UI-Kit)
to the design of the dummy nabla outpost platform. This contains the "component
sheet" page containing the whole set of components, a "documentation asset" 
page with all the assets used in this documentation and a "Frontend Platform
Interface" page containing some example screens of a custom outpost platform
interface. The following tutorial shows you the steps to create your custom 
design version of the platform by simply editing the colours, label and logo.

The result of a such a process, will give you a design showing what you will get
if you follow the instructions on the 
[customization guide](./customization/customizations) creating a code 
implementation associated to the colours code you set on the Figma file.

To better understand how the color are linked to the elements in the platform, 
please give a look at the [Theme Customization](./theme-customization) page.

### 1. Duplicate the Figma file
Click on the 
[**Figma** link](https://www.figma.com/file/qOzjC3bBlFk9CQZW2HK5jX/nabla---Outpost-UI-Kit)
and access the Figma file. Then, click on the arrow next to the 
"nabla - Outpost UI Kit" label on the top center of the page.

Now, you can duplicate the file to your draft, so you can use it and customize
it as you like.

### 2. Reach the customizable components
Click on the "Open" button, which will open the newly created file. It is your
own copy of the original design Figma file, and you can modify it as you like.
You are also able to perform modification on the components and deeply modify
the final result, but if you only want to style the dApp with your brand 
colours, you can simply follow the next steps.

![Open the duplicated file image](/img/user-interface-setup/frontend-platform-interface/design-customization/3.jpg "open the duplicated file")

Then, you can click on the "Components Sheet" page on the left sidebar to see
the page containing the customizable elements.

Now, you can zoom to the "Customizable" frame (which is the first on the left).

### 3. Set the colours palette

Once you reach the customizable frame, you can see the basic components which 
can be modified with a very low effort and which could provide a nice result
in terms of brand styling of the platform. From here, you can change all the
colours available on the right sidebar. While changing the colours on the right
you will see the corresponding coloured circle changing on the frame.

![Change all the colours image](/img/user-interface-setup/frontend-platform-interface/design-customization/6.jpg "change all the colours")

To edit a colour, first you need to click on the settings icon that appears
when you hover the colour with your pointer.

![Click on colour settings image](/img/user-interface-setup/frontend-platform-interface/design-customization/7.jpg "click on colour settings")

Then, you need to click on the coloured box which appears on the bottom left 
part of the newly opened popup.

![Click on the coloured box image](/img/user-interface-setup/frontend-platform-interface/design-customization/8.jpg "click on the coloured box")

At this point, you can select a color from the selector. You can both use the
colour picker, select the color by using the sliders, and select a method like 
RGB, Hex, HSL and so forth.

![Choose the colour image](/img/user-interface-setup/frontend-platform-interface/design-customization/9.jpg "choose the colour")

You need to repeat these steps for any colour you want to change.

### 4. Set the chain metadata

In the end, you can change the chain name and chain logo. 
To change the chain name, double click on it. First to edit it, ensure that
you selected the "Nabla" layer on the left sidebar. You need to overwrite it.

![Change the chain name image](/img/user-interface-setup/frontend-platform-interface/design-customization/10.jpg "change the chain name")

Similarly, you can change the chain logo. To do it, you can double click on it.
Before to modify the image, ensure that you selected the "Vector" layer on the 
left sidebar. You need to overwrite it.

#### Logo generation guidelines

The logo to provide must agree the following:

- frame width: **256px**;
- frame height: **256px**;
- background color: **transparent**;
- colour: single-color **WHITE**;
- format: **\*.svg**;

We attach some exmaples (Nabla, Osmosis and Juno) of logos to give you a guideline.
Please, access this page in dark mode to have a better experience.

| **nabla** |   | **Osmosis** |   | **Juno** |

### 5. Enjoy the result!

And... you are done! Now to enjoy the results of your efforts, you can reach 
the "Frontend Platform Interface" page and see the mockup you realized!!
