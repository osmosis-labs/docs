# Code Customization

Once you have followed and completed the 
[installation guide](../../installation) you should have a working demo of the 
*nabla branded* outpost platform. At this point, surely, you will be interested
in creating your own customized version of the platform.

All the configurations, both the logical ones (e.g., the *pricing sources*, the
*channels configuration*, etc.) and the style ones (i.e., the *theme* 
*configurations*) needs to be stored inside the `.env` file. 

An example of configuration, which is the one provided through the repository,
is available in the [Configuration Example](./configuration-example) page, 
while the following pages explain how to configure all the file items.

Moreover, if you are interested in learning more about what *technologies* we
used to construct the platform, you can give a look at the 
[Useful Information](../../useful-information) page.
