# Theme Customization

The set of custom *colours and contents* are linked to the configuration theme.
In this scenario, you can see how the elements in the page are linked to the 
**colours palette**.

### Platform interface

In the platform, the interface is mainly made up of a **central widget** - 
which allows the swaps - and some other useful *CTAs* around it, like the
current connected wallet, the notifications for the txs, the select to navigate
the various outposts, and some links.

According to the **Widget** customizations for the central element included in 
the platform, please give a look at the 
[related documentation](../../widget/customization-guide/theme-customization).
