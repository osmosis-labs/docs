# Customizability

As already stated, each outpost chain can compose its own *frontend platform* 
*interface* by customizing the provided one in the *colours, logo, and links*.

For this *platform interface*, we provide you both the design file (the 
[**Figma** link](https://www.figma.com/file/qOzjC3bBlFk9CQZW2HK5jX/nabla---Outpost-UI-Kit))
and the implementation (the link to the 
[**GitHub** repository](https://github.com/nabla-studio/osmosis-outposts-ui/tree/main)).

In this way, you can both edit the design and the code to match your specific
requirements. As you can see from the image below, the interface is mainly made
up of a **central widget** - which allows the swaps - and some other useful 
*CTAs* around it.

Both the page and the widget use a theme, which allows you to 
customize the entire dApp interface by simply changing **a palette of colors**.
Here, you can also set *your chain logo, name, and some content* in the page.

> **_NOTE:_**  To get more information about what style pieces you can change 
in the page, please see the documentation 
[here](./theme-customization).
