# How to set the slippage tolerance

When you make a trade and the price changes during the processing period, 
slippage refers to the amount of price difference you are okay with accepting.
It is important to consider this factor when placing a trade. **By default,** 
**the slippage tolerance is set to the 3%**.

### 1. Access the settings

To set a custom value for the slippage tolerance you need to access the 
**settings** of the dApp. To do this, you must click on the *settings icon* in
the top right corner of the interface.

### 2. Set the slippage tolerance value

At this point, you can *select the slippage tolerance* from one of the 
available values *by clicking on the corresponding button*.
Otherwise, you can insert a custom value by filling the last input box with any
**valid numeric value**.
