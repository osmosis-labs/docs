# How to perform a swap

### 1. Connect a wallet

To **swap tokens**, the fist step is to connect the wallet containing such 
tokens to the dApp. To do this, you can *click* on one of the two "connect
wallet" buttons available on the page (one on the bottom right, the other on
the bottom center). Once the wallet is connected to the dApp, you can see the 
corresponding address to the top right part of the page.

### 2. Select the "from" tokens

You need to choose **which** tokens you would like to swap. You can perform 
such selection via the first *dropdown* list in the top section of the form.

### 3. Select the "to" tokens

Then you need to select **to which** tokens you would like to swap. Such a 
selection can be done via the *dropdown* list in the bottom section of the 
form.

### 4. Enter the amount of tokens

You must set the **amount** of tokens you want to swap. You can input
this value in the *numeric input* in the top section of the form, next to the
*from token dropdown*. The counter value in dollars is shown (as per 
Coingeckoâ€™s prices) exactly below the value in crypto. Once you edit such a 
value, the corresponding value for the other token is automatically evaluated,
and it appears in the bottom section of the form, next to the *to token*
*dropdown*.

<!-- If you prefer to set the number of tokens to be received through the swap 
rather than the number of tokens to be swapped, you can set the amount in the 
bottom section of the form, next to the *to token dropdown*. This will 
automatically evaluate the corresponding value for the swapping "from" tokens. -->

### 5. Swap the tokens

Press the **swap** button and confirm the transaction through your wallet. Now 
you need to wait for the whole process to be completed (*transactions* 
*broadcasted* to the networks and *smart contract executed*) and... then you're
done!
