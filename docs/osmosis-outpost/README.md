# What is an Osmosis Outpost

An Osmosis outpost is a platform that makes it *much simpler* to perform swaps
on different *Cosmos chains*, without having to manually send the tokens to 
Osmosis to trade them, or worse, to build their own DEx.

The outpost performs the swaps through the **Osmosis DEX** and can send the
swapped token to the outpost chain. Such a platform uses **IBC protocol** and
**smart contracts** to allow users on the outpost chain to *perform the swaps*.

It is important for the UI of such a platform to be *simple, intuitive, and* 
*highly customizable* for each outpost chain and, for this reason, **nabla** 
provides a set of **components** and **templates** to allow any enabled chain 
to realize its own *frontend outpost*.

If you want to create your own outpost platform, please follow the instruction
available at the [Introduction page](./user-interface-setup/introduction).
