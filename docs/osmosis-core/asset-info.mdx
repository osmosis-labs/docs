# Asset Info

import AssetData from './AssetData';

Osmosis frontend supports various assets with corresponding IBC denomination and channel. When assets are transferred through IBC, they obtain a new IBC denomination that is used to identify them in the frontend. The IBC channel is used to identify which chain the asset is from, for example, channel-0 for ATOMs transferred from the Cosmos Hub to Osmosis. [You can learn more about IBC here.](https://docs.osmosis.zone/osmosis-core/ibc/)
