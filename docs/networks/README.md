# Osmosis Network
Recommended API Endpoints and Frontend URLs for Osmosis Network, Chain Registry, and Other Providers.

## Official public endpoints
These following API's are recommended for development purposes. For maximun control and reliability it's recommended to run your own node. This can be easility accomplsihed by using the get.osmosis.zone installer. 


:::warning Important Notice
### 
> **On June 15th, 2023**, `osmo-test-4` will be soft deleted. The new official testnet will be `osmo-test-5`. 
>
> `osmo-test-5` is not a fork of mainnet, it has started with no state.
>
> Devnet and edgenet are now available at https://github.com/osmosis-labs/testnets
